                    <p>Born and rised at Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, I always been a video-game lover. I've playing most of my life and always enjoyed. When I became a tennager, I started thinking how I could make my own games, after wathing "Indie Game", a documentary that I found on Netflix. That's when I discovered programming, or game programming. I started using Unity, a game engine, to make my firt games, than I have to learn C#, for coding games.<p>
                    <p>After that, I had to leave game development behind. So I left from programming for a long time, util now, that I'm in college. I choose to stude Computer Science for knowing a little bit of C# programming and have some knoledge. That's where I knew Java and HTML, two leanguages that I'm learning to love.<p>
